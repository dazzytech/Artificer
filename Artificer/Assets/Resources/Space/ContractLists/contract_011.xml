    <name>Defence Contract 12/07/6456: UAN</name>
    <desc>A client has requested support in the defence of one of their command centers. Their military strength is very limited due to the amount of assaults by insurgent groups. 

An enemy faction has taken siege of this station in hopes to further destablize the faction.

Defend the station and do not let the station fall. It is recommended that you upgrade your ship from the template as to improve your chances of success.

This has been regarded as an act of war, and we can be expected to be called upon for support.</desc>
