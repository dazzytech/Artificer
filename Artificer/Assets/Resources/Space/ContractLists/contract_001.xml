    <desc>One of our clients have requested support for one of their factory stations. Following increased aggression with a neighboring system, a small group hostile to our client is attempting to harrass and destroy the factory station closest to the outskirts of their teritory.

Following probes these terrorists are little more than civilian ships outfitted with little more than simple weapon kits. They have little to no combat training and are a minor threat at best. Caution is still advised however, a well placed hit can do damage.

Keep the station in working order for the specified time. This time slot has proven to have the highest amount of attacking vessels.</desc>
