    <desc>Our client has requested support in defending one of their stations. The client has stressed the strategic importance of this station. This station used for intelligence operations and the loss of such station will impact the client negatively.

The strength of the assailents, although they are growing in number, is still relatively weak. They have started to move and engage their forces much more tactically however, and their choice of target does lead to question whether or not they are being instructed. 

As well as defending the station, you are required to eliminate the targets. Reduce their numbers before they are established as a threat.</desc>
